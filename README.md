# Raid

Simple console raid simulation

## API requirements

- Create player
- Invite another player to party
- Go for the raid (Chain: seek for boss then start raid)
- Attack boss
- Defend up

> Boss must attack by timeout 
> Killing boss should grant loot for party members - that's for next steps
